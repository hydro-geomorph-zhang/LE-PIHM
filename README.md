# LE-PIHM

This is the second version of the landscape evolution model (LE-PIHM) that couples surface and subsurface hydrologic
processes with landscape evolution, including hillslope erosion and deposition, bedrock weathering, and tectonic bedrock uplift. 

Detailed information of this model refers to Zhang et al., (2016).
